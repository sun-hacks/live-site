                                                ASU is hosting a lot of events this weekend, you may have trouble parking. If you're able to, please carpool/rideshare/etc. If you park at any of the garages know that you'll have to pay for your stay until 6AM on Saturday morning (when the gates to the garage open). Then you'll be able to freely come and go. Parking may get very busy from 1p - 9p as a result of an ASU football game and Gammage event in the evening on Saturday. The northern parking garages will not be free to access. Sunday will have no parking issues.

                                            <p class="answer">You'll need to bring a laptop, charger, any tech you might want to hack on or with. As we are a 3 day hackathon,
                                            we encourage you to bring toiletries and any other materials you deem relevant. We highly encourage you bring sleeping paraphernalia
                                            to ensure you get a good night's rest each night (or not, we understand you're excited to hack, but remember to take care of yourself!).
                                            We will have a sleeping area designated and showers will be provided! So don't forget to bring towel and soap!<br />In addition, sunhacks is working toward becoming a sustainable hackathon, that means we aren't providing water bottles this year, and are asking that you bring your own. Since we'll be providing coffee as well, we encourage you to bring your own mug (you might get a chance to show it off on our social media and win something for it!)</p>

                                            addressing these concerns by providing introductory workshops, encouraging mentors to interact with all hackers, and creating
                                            a positive environment. Please don't feel bad asking a mentor questions, they're there to help and have been given a guide on how to best help you. </p>

                                            We'd encourage you to work in a team so you can have people to learn from, bounce ideas off of, and break work down into manageable chunks! </p>

                                            who want to help you with your project—or maybe you want to help them with theirs! We have activities planned to help
